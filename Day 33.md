Problems in Database
-
* Static Schema on write and read means we have fixed the schema when we planned to design the schema of table.

* When we have to add or remove any column in database then another user cannot add or read the database

Features of NoSQL (Not only SQL)
-
* Dynamic Schema
* Automatic Scalability of table


*   Example :- Google Big Table

Types of NoSQL Databases Engines
-
* Document Oriented Database
    * Examples- MongoDB, CouchDB 
    
    * Links, Docks, Text, Few Images
* Columns Oriented Database
    * Can print only specific column without reading that column

    * Examples- Google Big Table, DynamoDB (AWS), Hbase (Opensource), Cassendra (Opensource)

* Key-Value Type NoSQL
    * Use for Caching majorly
    * Examples- Redis (amazon Front DB), Mem Cached

* Graph DB
    * BlockChain Technology is used in this DB
    * Information is forwarded in tokens or pieces
    * Example- Neo4j (Non Hackable)

## **DynamoDB**

* Fully Managed NoSQL Database
* Biggest Example is PUBG

* Ashu Sir python code for DynamoDB with AWS

https://github.com/redashu/dbconnect/blob/master/dynamnodb/dynamo.py

* Insertion into Table

https://github.com/redashu/dbconnect/blob/master/dynamnodb/write_into_table.py

* AWS Lambda => It is responsible for allocating resources(CPU, RAM, etc) to DynamoDB
