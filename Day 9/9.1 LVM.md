# **Device Mapper**
## **LVM (Logical Volume Management):-** 
```
    [Real time Storage] Original Harddisk -> Physical Volume
    Virtual Harddisk -> Volume Group
    Partition of Virtual HDD -> Logical Volume

pvcreate /dev/xvd{h,g} OR pvcreate /dev/xvdh /dev/xvdg      -> p= physical, v= volume, h,g= name of hdd; create 2 Physical Volume

yum whatprovide */pvcreate    -> shows the packages which includes pvcreate command 
```
```
vgcreate myvirhdd /dev/xvdh /dev/xvdg   -> myvirhdd= name of virtual hdd; Create a Volume Group

vgdisplay myvirhdd      -> myvirhdd= name of virual hdd; shows the info of Volume Group

    [Imp. term] PE Size (Physical Extend)= Similar to Sector in real hdd(Bydefault 4MB size but can be changed)
 ```
 ```
lvcreate --name part1 --size 400M myvirhdd      -> name= give the name  of partition, size= give the size  of partition; create Logical Volume

lvdisplay       -> shows the info. of Logical Volume

mkfs.xfs /dev/mapper/myvirhdd-part1     -> Format the partition
mkdir /mnt/google                       -> Make directory in mount folder 
mount /dev/mapper/myvirhdd-part1 /mnt/google    -> Mount the partition
mount -a                                -> check if mount is done successfully or not
```
